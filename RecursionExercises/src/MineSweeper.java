/**
 *  Simple 'Minesweeper' program.
 *  There is a grid of squares, some of which contain a mine.
 *  The user can click on a square to either expose it or to
 *  mark/unmark it.
 *  
 *  If the user exposes a square with a mine, they lose.
 *  Otherwise, it is uncovered, and shows a number which represents the
 *  number of mines in the eight squares surrounding that one.
 *  If there are no mines adjacent to it, then all the unexposed squares
 *  immediately adjacent to it are exposed (and and so on)
 *
 *  If the user marks a square, then they cannot expose the square,
 *  (unless they unmark it first)
 *  When all squares with mines are marked, and all the squares without
 *  mines are exposed, the user has won.
